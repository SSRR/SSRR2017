Any demo relevant to Safety, Security or Rescue Robotics is welcome. Please see the <a href="../submissions">submissions</a> page for details on how to submit a proposal for a demo.

<h2> Competition </h2>

There will also be a small competition held in paralel to SSRR 2017. The main goal here is to have some rescue robots running around and to demonstrate their capabilities in a live arena. <p/>

The arena will be composed out of a few selected standard robot <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/test-methods">test elements</a>. The elements will be at the 60cm scale, that is half the width of a standard <a href="http://wiki.robocup.org/images/6/65/2016-03RoboCupRescueRulebookv3.pdf">RoboCup Rescue arena</a>. Any ground robot that fits in the arena is welcome - please contact Sören Schwetfeger (soerensch AT shanghaitech.edu.cn) for details and if you want to participate.

<p>
The following test elements will be part of the competition - please refer to the  <a href="http://wiki.robocup.org/images/6/65/2016-03RoboCupRescueRulebookv3.pdf">RoboCup Rescue rulebook</a> for more info:
<ul>
<li> (MAN 1) Center​ (60cm)
<li> (MAN 2) Align (60cm)
<li> (MAN 3) Traverse (60cm)
<li> (MAN 4) Crossover (60cm)
<li> (MOB 2) Sand/Gravel Hills (60cm)
<li> (MOB 3) Stepfields (60cm)
<li> Stairs (we will use the concrete stairs of the building)
<li> (DEX 1) Parallel Pipes (provides multipliers for all above tests - details tbd.)
<li> (DEX 2) Omni­Directional​Pipes (provides multipliers for all above tests - details tbd.)
<li> Maze for mapping and autonomy (60cm) (Tests: 2D mapping, 3D mapping, autonomous exploration, identification)
</ul>
You will have 10 minutes teleoperation plus extra 10 minutes autonomy time. <br>
Reset: 2min time penalty for each touching the robot. After a reset the robot has to start from the start zone again. The robot keeps the points achieved so far. <br>
The idintification items to be autonomously identified are: QR codes, Hazmat signs and fire extinguishers.<p>
Every team gets X runs (X is tbd. - also depends on the number of participants). Every team is free to choose which test they want to perform. For each test the best score will be noted. A ranking will be established for each test. Awards will be given based on how well teams perform on the different tests - details tbd.
