<h2> Competition </h2>

There will also be a small competition held in paralel to SSRR 2017. The main goal here is to have some rescue robots running around and to demonstrate their capabilities in a live arena. <p/>

The arena will be composed out of a few selected standard robot <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/test-methods">test elements</a>. The elements will be at the 60cm scale, that is half the width of a standard <a href="http://wiki.robocup.org/images/6/65/2016-03RoboCupRescueRulebookv3.pdf">RoboCup Rescue arena</a>. Any ground robot that fits in the arena is welcome - please contact SÃ¶ren Schwetfeger (soerensch AT shanghaitech.edu.cn) for details and if you want to participate.
