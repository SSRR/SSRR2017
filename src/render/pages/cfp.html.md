## IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics

## Oct 11 - 13, 2017, Shanghai, China

### **[CfP as PDF](../../cfp_v1.pdf)**

The 15th IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics 2017 (SSRR 2017) is inviting cutting-edge papers in the theory and practice of robotics and automation for all types of safety, security, and rescue applications such as disaster response, mitigation and recovery; rapid and secure inspection of critical infrastructure; detection of chemical, biological and radiological risks, and operations in these dangerous sites. 


### Papers and participation fall into:

* Regular papers (4-6 pages) describing original work in SSR or work that can be applied to SSR domains.
* Center/project papers (2-4 pages) describing work at centers or active multi-institutional projects.
* Vision papers (2-4) presenting long-term challenges or new ideas outside of the mainstream in computing for SSR robotics.
* Late Breaking Reports (1-2 pages) contributing novel directions or work which has not been fully analyzed or explored. Late Breaking Reports are reviewed and the relevance of the material to the SSR domains must be clear.


### Submission

Submissions of original papers focused on traditional and emerging areas and applications in safety, security, and rescue robotics are encouraged. All papers will appear in IEEE Xplore. 
Nominated contributions for "Best Paper" and "Best Student Paper" awards and other outstanding papers that report field experiments will be considered for a special issue of the Journal of Field Robotics. Video and late-breaking-reports will be also considered and included in the program. Submission guidelines will be found in the SSRR website.


### Awards

SSRR 2017 will have four awards:

* Best Paper Award
* Best Student Paper Award
* Best Late Breaking Reports Award
* Best Demonstration Award


### Important Dates

* Jun 29: Paper submission
* Aug 1: Notification of acceptance
* Aug 12: Video and Late Breaking Reports submission
* Aug 26: Late Breaking Reports acceptance
* Sep 1: Final papers due
* Oct 11-13: Conference
