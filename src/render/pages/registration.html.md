Online registration will be handled by paperplaza. 

Every registrant can present and publish one paper. For a second paper a second registrant is needed or the extra paper fee has to be payed. Final papers can only be uploaded after the registration fee has been payed.

Regular papers are up to 6 pages. Up to 2 additional pages may be purchased. No additional pages are available for Late Breaking Reports. 

Fapiao (发票 - official Chinese invoices) are not available when doing online registration, since SSRR is a 100% IEEE financed conference, thus it is incorporated in the US. 

Fapiaos will be available for the on-site registration in RMB. If a Chinese author needs a fapiao he should contact Sören Schwertfeger (soerensch@shanghaitech.edu.cn) to be able to upload the final paper without registration. The paper will only be published if the (more expensive) on-site registration in RMB, for which the fapiao is available, has been completed and the paper has been presented at the conference.

Please send proof of student status (for August 1st), your IEEE member number and a short recommendation letter from your academic advisor to soerensch@shanghaitech.edu.cn .
